# CASL Code Snippets and Blog Post Scripts

## CASL Code Snippets
This repo includes a variety CASL code snippets to process data in the CAS server in SAS Viya. The CAS server is distributed server that uses multiple machines to perform massively parallel processing (MPP). 

- For more information about the CAS server visit the [SAS® Cloud Analytic Services: Fundamentals documentation](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/v_032/casfun/titlepage.htm).
- For more information about the CASL language visit the [SAS® Cloud Analytic Services: CASL Programmer’s Guide](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/v_032/caslpg/titlepage.htm)


## SAS-Viya-Blogs

### The following linkes are for my SAS Viya programming blogs:

- [CAS Action! - a series on fundamentals](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sgf/2021/08/06/cas-action-a-series-on-fundamentals/)
- [Getting Started with Python Integration to SAS® Viya® - Index](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sgf/2020/06/19/getting-started-with-python-integration-to-sas-viya-index/)

The CAS Action blogs scripts are stored in the CAS Action Blogs folder.

NOTE: Training and demo images were used to create the blogs and code snippets. Some demo passwords are included in the code. In a production environment you should never include your password in plain text. These are simple training images, so the passwords were used to show how to connect to the CAS server.
