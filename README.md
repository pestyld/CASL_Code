# SAS-Viya-Blogs

## The following notebooks are for my SAS Viya programming blogs:

- [CAS Action! - a series on fundamentals](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sgf/2021/08/06/cas-action-a-series-on-fundamentals/)
- [Getting Started with Python Integration to SAS® Viya® - Index](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sgf/2020/06/19/getting-started-with-python-integration-to-sas-viya-index/)

NOTE: Training images were used to create the blogs. Some demo passwords are included. In a production environment you should never include your password in plain text. These are simple training images, so the passwords were used to show how to connect to the CAS server.
